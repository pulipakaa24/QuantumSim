# QuantumSim
For Quantum computing FRI Final Project - Create a quantum simulator that:
- Takes in a .qasm file as input & parses Qubit Operations, Quantum/Classical Registers
- Computes the circuit via applying sequenced gates
- Takes in error probability from the user which it applies in the form of a depolarization channel
- Outputs final state vector with simulated shot counts
